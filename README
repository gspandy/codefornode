== CodeForNode ==

This project serves as a little playground for some xml fun.

It takes an arbitrary XML document and converts it into a model supported by the "jet-generator" project.
Though there are many other (better) means of generating code from a schema, this works well for rapid-prototyping
xml w/o a schema, or just to examine an xml document.

This project also provides an XPaths utility which lists all xpaths for a given xml document.

== To build/run ==
This project is built using SBT. Without any params, it launches a UI which allows the user to chose an xml file and destination directory.


= Dependencies =
This project depends on codefornode-ui 

https://github.com/aaronp/codefornode-ui

and the jet-generator

https://github.com/aaronp/jet-generator

Currently I've been building and manually copying those dependencies to the 'lib' folder -- I spent minimal time asking SBT to resolve them for me, but somehow it wasn't playing nicely ... ?
