== CodeForNode ==

This project serves as a little playground for some xml fun.

It takes an arbitrary XML document and coverts it to the form supported by the jet-generator project.
Though there are many other (better) means of generating code from a schema, this works well for rapid-prototyping
xml w/o a schema.

Also, there is an XPaths utility which can list all xpaths for a given xml document

Without any params, it launches a UI which allows the user to chose an xml file and destination directory.


= Dependencies =
This project depends on codefornode-ui 

https://github.com/aaronp/codefornode-ui

and the jet-generator

https://github.com/aaronp/jet-generator

Currently I've been building and manually copying those dependencies to the 'lib' folder -- I spent minimal time asking sbt to resolve them for me, but somehow it didn't want to play nicely.
